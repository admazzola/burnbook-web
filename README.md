# BUY THE FLOOR 
 
Web frontend for Demand Based NFT Exchange
 


IMPROVE LATER: 
- build subgraphs for wrapped mooncats and wrapped punks that give orig ids and wrap ids  !!! Per owner .


### TODO
 
-run server with pm2 
-server needs to validate packets and throw them away if bad (if wrong networkID for server config, if bad hash, etc)  Then we can accept packets from an API 


2.5)   Limit users to only having 10 bids,  min amt for bid 



3) build subgraphs to be able to show users items on website (subgraph for sales on this platform)

4) make it easier to wrap things - wrapping on the site 


 -better filter on front page (later)

 -API 
 
 - develop a subgraph to do data collection and show sales on front page
