# BUY THE FLOOR 
 


Dev and building requires node 10 (fix later) 

Server requires node 14 


try to do ping/pong w apexrelay server. 
 


IMPROVE LATER: 
- build subgraphs for wrapped mooncats and wrapped punks that give orig ids and wrap ids  !!! Per owner .


### TODO
1) Build the NEW BID page 
-done

2) Finish data querying using alchemy on server  to mark bids 
-done 

2.5)   Limit users to only having 10 bids,  min amt for bid 



3) build subgraphs to be able to show users items on website (subgraph for sales on this platform)

4) make it easier to wrap things - wrapping on the site 




** FIX SSL

I can ping pong to this 
https://github.com/metawallet-web/meta-relay-node
